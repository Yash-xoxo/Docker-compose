A puzzle game in Python thatâ€™s unique and challenging: Grid Shift Puzzle.

Concept:

The game consists of a 5x5 grid of numbers, where each row or column can be shifted left, right, up, or down. The goal is to rearrange the numbers in ascending order, starting from 1 and ending at 25.

Gameplay:

A grid of random numbers (from 1 to 25) is generated.
You can select a row or column and shift it left, right, up, or down.
The goal is to rearrange the numbers to be in ascending order (left to right, top to bottom).

Features:

Unlimited moves, but the goal is to solve in the fewest moves.
Each shift moves the entire row/column by one unit, wrapping numbers around.
Add a timer and a move counter for extra challenge.
